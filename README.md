## Currency Converter

## Description
The Currency Converter is a useful tool for anyone who needs to deal with multiple currencies, whether for personal or business purposes. 
With its dynamic HTML and CSS, the application fetches real-time currency rate from a reliable third-party API. By using this application, you can quickly and easily convert between currencies and get accurate and up-to-date exchange rate information. 

## Usage
To use the Currency Converter:

1. Select the currency you are converting from and the currency you are converting to. This can be done by selecting the appropriate options from a dropdown menu or by entering the currency codes or names manually.
2. Enter the amount of the currency you are converting. This can be done by typing the value into a text box.
3. Click the "Convert" button to see the converted value. The currency converter will use the current exchange rate between the two currencies to calculate the value.
4. Optionally, you may also be able to see the exchange rate between the two currencies and a historical chart of exchange rates for those currencies.
5. Once you have obtained the converted value, you can use it for whatever purpose you need, such as making a purchase, paying a bill, or tracking your expenses.
